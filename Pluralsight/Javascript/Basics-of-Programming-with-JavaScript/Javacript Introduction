- Source code is for the developer: another dev or even for you later on. 
- Source code compiles into machine code that a computer can understand.


The syntax of a program language can be thought of like the grammar for spoken/written language.

Statements
-A statement in a computer language is a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task. In JavaScript, a statement might look as follows:

	a = b * 2;
	
Like sentences, statements can also be compound; accomplishing more than one task. But typically there's a 1-to-1 relationship between a statement and what you want to do.

In JS, a completed statement ends in a semicolon ";". Though not always.


Keyword = a word that has special meaning in the language, e.g. "function" or "var".
Identifier = variable



Expressions
Statements are comprised of parts called expressions.

	a = b * 2;
	
Is comprised of several expresion. 
- 2 is a literal expression. an expressed literal value
- b is an identifier expression. because we identified b.
- b * 2 is a multiplication expression/arithmetic expression. because we did math
- a = b * 2 is an assignment expression. because it's being assigned.

If we surround the expressions with parentheses:

	((a) = ((b) * (2)));

and the whole this is a statement.

example
a = b * 2 + foo(c * 3);
[[a] = [[[b] * [2]] + [foo([[c] * [3]])]]];



Operator precedence = order of operations
